## üìù Development Areas

### Code Generation
- **Component Architecture**: AI-generated React components with TypeScript
- **Performance Optimizations**: React.memo, useCallback, useMemo implementations
- **API Service Layer**: Mock API with retry logic and error handling
- **Custom Hooks**: Scroll animations and keyboard shortcuts

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Setup**: Vitest configuration with React Testing Library
- **Component Tests**: User interaction testing for all major components
- **Mock Services**: API testing with error simulation and retry behavior
- **Test Debugging**: Resolved React plugin configuration issues

### Styling & Design
- **Tailwind Implementation**: Enterprise-grade design system
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with accessibility
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions and loading states
- **Design Tokens**: Consistent color palette and spacing

### Performance Optimization
- **React Memoization**: Comprehensive memo strategy across components
- **Event Handler Optimization**: Memoized callbacks to prevent re-renders
- **Computation Caching**: useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Vite configuration for optimal builds

## üîß Technical Problem Solving

### Configuration Challenges
- **Vitest Setup**: Resolved React plugin preamble detection issues
- **TypeScript Integration**: Strict type checking with modern ES modules
- **Replit Deployment**: Host configuration for proper port binding

### Debugging Assistance
- **Component Testing**: Fixed import/export issues in test files
- **API Integration**: Real endpoint attempts with mock fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### Architecture Decisions
- **Service Layer Design**: Singleton pattern for API services
- **State Management**: Local React state with hooks (no external state library)
- **Component Structure**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

## üìä AI Development Workflow

### 1. Requirements Analysis
