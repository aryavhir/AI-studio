# AI Usage Documentation

This document outlines how AI tools were used in the development of AI Studio Pro.

## ü§ñ AI Tools Used

**Primary AI Assistant**: Replit Agent
- **Role**: Full-stack development, architecture design, testing setup
- **Usage Pattern**: Iterative development with continuous feedback

## üìù Development Areas

### Code Generation
- **Performance Optimizations**: React.memo, useCallback, useMemo implementations

- **Custom Hooks**: Scroll animations and keyboard shortcuts

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Setup**: Vitest configuration with React Testing Library
- **Component Tests**: User interaction testing for all major components
- **Test Debugging**: Resolved React plugin configuration issues

### Styling & Design
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions and loading states

### Performance Optimization

- **Event Handler Optimization**: Memoized callbacks to prevent re-renders
- **Computation Caching**: useMemo for expensive calculations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Vite configuration for optimal builds


### Debugging Assistance
- **Component Testing**: Fixed import/export issues in test files
- **API Integration**: Real endpoint attempts with mock fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

### Architecture Decisions
- **Service Layer Design**: Singleton pattern for API services
- **State Management**: Local React state with hooks (no external state library)
- **Component Structure**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns


## üéØ AI Contributions

### Code Quality
- **Performance**: React optimization patterns applied consistently
- **Accessibility**: ARIA support and keyboard navigation throughout
- **Error Handling**: Robust error states with user-friendly messaging

### Developer Experience
- **Modern Tooling**: Vite for fast development with HMR
